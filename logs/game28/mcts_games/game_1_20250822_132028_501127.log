Bid: Player 0 proposes 25 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 25
    overall: avg=25.00  p30=25.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      S: pts=[22]  avg=22.00  p30=22.00  std=0.00

      H: pts=[17]  avg=17.00  p30=17.00  std=0.00
      D: pts=[9]  avg=9.00  p30=9.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit C meets thresholds (p30=25.00, conf_mean=25.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 25. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
