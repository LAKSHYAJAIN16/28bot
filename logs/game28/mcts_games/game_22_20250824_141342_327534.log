Bid: Player 0 proposes 28 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:

    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 28
    overall: avg=28.00  p30=28.00  std=0.00

      C: pts=[15]  avg=15.00  p30=15.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=28.00, conf_mean=28.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 28. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
