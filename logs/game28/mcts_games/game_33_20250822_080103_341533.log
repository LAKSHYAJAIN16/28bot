      H: pts=[17]  avg=17.00  p30=17.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=24.00, conf_mean=24.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 24. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
Bid: Player 1 proposes 27 (min_allowed=25)

    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 27
    overall: avg=27.00  p30=27.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=27.00, conf_mean=27.00 >= min_allowed=25); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 27. (current_high=24, raise_delta=+1)
