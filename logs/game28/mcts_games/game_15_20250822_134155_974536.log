      S: p30 0.00 < 15; conf_mean 0.00 < 15
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit D has p30=9.00, conf_mean=10.78 below min_allowed=16 (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 9.00 < 15, conf_mean 10.78 < 15.

    overall: avg=28.00  p30=28.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit D meets thresholds (p30=28.00, conf_mean=28.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 28. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
