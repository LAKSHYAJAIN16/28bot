  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=13.50  p30=14.00  std=2.18
    failed_checks:

      S: p30 0.00 < 15; conf_mean 0.00 < 15
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit D has p30=14.00, conf_mean=12.41 below min_allowed=16 (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 14.00 < 15, conf_mean 12.41 < 15.

    overall: avg=18.00  p30=18.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=18.00, conf_mean=18.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 18. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
