    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 20
    overall: avg=20.00  p30=20.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit D meets thresholds (p30=20.00, conf_mean=20.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 20. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
