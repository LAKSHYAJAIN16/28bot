    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=16.38  p30=14.00  std=2.69

      S: p30 0.00 < 15; conf_mean 0.00 < 15
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit H has p30=14.00, conf_mean=15.03 below min_allowed=16 (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 14.00 < 15.
