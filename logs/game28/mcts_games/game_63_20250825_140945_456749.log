Bid: Player 0 proposes 19 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:

      C: pts=[13, 20, 9, 25, 6, 12 ...]  avg=17.44  p30=14.00  std=5.51
      H: pts=[19]  avg=19.00  p30=19.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit H meets thresholds (p30=19.00, conf_mean=19.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 19. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
