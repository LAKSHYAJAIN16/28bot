Bid: Player 3 proposes 20 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, S

    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 20
    overall: avg=20.38  p30=20.00  std=2.96
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=20.00, conf_mean=18.90 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 20. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
