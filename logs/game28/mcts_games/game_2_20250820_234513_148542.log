Bid: Player 3 proposes 18 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 18
    overall: avg=19.00  p30=17.00  std=3.12
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=17.00, conf_mean=17.44 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 18. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
