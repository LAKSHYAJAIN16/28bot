Bid: Player 3 proposes 18 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:

    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 18
    overall: avg=18.00  p30=18.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=18.00, conf_mean=18.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 18. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
