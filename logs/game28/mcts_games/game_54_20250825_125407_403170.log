Bid: Player 0 proposes 18 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 18
    overall: avg=18.00  p30=18.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      H: pts=[19, 3, 7, 13, 20, 7 ...]  avg=13.56  p30=7.00  std=5.84
      D: pts=[18]  avg=18.00  p30=18.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=18.00, conf_mean=18.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 18. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
