Bid: Player 2 proposes 16 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:

    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 16
    overall: avg=16.00  p30=16.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=16.00, conf_mean=16.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 16. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
