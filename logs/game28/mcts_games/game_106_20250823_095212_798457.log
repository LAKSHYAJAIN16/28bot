Bid: Player 0 proposes 25 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 25
    overall: avg=25.00  p30=25.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=25.00, conf_mean=25.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 25. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)

      S: p30 0.00 < 25; conf_mean 0.00 < 25
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit C has p30=14.00, conf_mean=13.80 below min_allowed=26 (current_high=25, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 14.00 < 25, conf_mean 13.80 < 25.
