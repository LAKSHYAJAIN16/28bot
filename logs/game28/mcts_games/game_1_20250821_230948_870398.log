    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=14.12  p30=11.00  std=5.06

      S: p30 11.00 < 15; conf_mean 11.59 < 15
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit S has p30=11.00, conf_mean=11.59 below min_allowed=16 (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 11.00 < 15, conf_mean 11.59 < 15.

      S: pts=[19]  avg=19.00  p30=19.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit S meets thresholds (p30=19.00, conf_mean=19.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 19. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
