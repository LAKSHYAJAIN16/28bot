===== AUCTION =====
Bid: Player 0 proposes 20 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 20
    overall: avg=20.00  p30=20.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=20.00, conf_mean=20.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 20. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
Pass (locked): Player 1 (min_allowed=21)

    present_suits: H, S
    current_high=20  min_allowed=21  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=13.00  p30=10.00  std=10.05
    failed_checks:
      S: p30 10.00 < 20; conf_mean 7.98 < 20
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit S has p30=10.00, conf_mean=7.98 below min_allowed=21 (current_high=20, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 10.00 < 20, conf_mean 7.98 < 20.
