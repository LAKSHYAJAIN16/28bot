    overall: avg=25.00  p30=25.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      D: pts=[16]  avg=16.00  p30=16.00  std=0.00

      C: pts=[7]  avg=7.00  p30=7.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit H meets thresholds (p30=25.00, conf_mean=25.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 25. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
