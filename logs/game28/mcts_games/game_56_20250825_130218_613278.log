    chosen_suit: H
    proposed_bid: 16
    overall: avg=15.00  p30=15.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      H: pts=[15]  avg=15.00  p30=15.00  std=0.00

      D: pts=[14]  avg=14.00  p30=14.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit H meets thresholds (p30=15.00, conf_mean=15.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 16. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
