Pass (locked): Player 0 (min_allowed=16)

Bid: Player 1 proposes 20 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: H
    proposed_bid: 20
    overall: avg=20.00  p30=20.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      C: pts=[5]  avg=5.00  p30=5.00  std=0.00
      S: pts=[10]  avg=10.00  p30=10.00  std=0.00
      D: pts=[8]  avg=8.00  p30=8.00  std=0.00
      H: pts=[20]  avg=20.00  p30=20.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit H meets thresholds (p30=20.00, conf_mean=20.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 20. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)

    failed_checks:
      H: p30 4.00 < 20; conf_mean 4.00 < 20

      C: p30 19.00 < 20; conf_mean 19.00 < 20
      S: p30 0.00 < 20; conf_mean 0.00 < 20
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit C has p30=19.00, conf_mean=19.00 below min_allowed=21 (current_high=20, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 19.00 < 20, conf_mean 19.00 < 20.

    failed_checks:
