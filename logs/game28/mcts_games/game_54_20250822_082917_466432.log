    overall: avg=16.00  p30=16.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      H: pts=[15, 14, 25, 8, 9, 14 ...]  avg=13.25  p30=9.00  std=5.09
      D: pts=[16]  avg=16.00  p30=16.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=16.00, conf_mean=16.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 16. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
