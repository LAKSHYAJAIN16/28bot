    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 17
    overall: avg=17.00  p30=17.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      S: pts=[17, 21, 15, 16, 16, 16 ...]  avg=17.50  p30=16.00  std=3.16
      D: pts=[17]  avg=17.00  p30=17.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=17.00, conf_mean=17.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 17. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
