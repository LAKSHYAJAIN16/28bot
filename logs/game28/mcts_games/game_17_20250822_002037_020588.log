Bid: Player 2 proposes 23 (min_allowed=16)

    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 23
    overall: avg=23.00  p30=23.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=23.00, conf_mean=23.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 23. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
