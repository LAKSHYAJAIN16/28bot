    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 21
    overall: avg=21.00  p30=21.00  std=0.00
    suit_stats:
      C: pts=[19]  avg=19.00  p30=19.00  std=0.00

      S: pts=[14]  avg=14.00  p30=14.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit D meets thresholds (p30=21.00, conf_mean=21.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 21. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
