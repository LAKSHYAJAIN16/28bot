Bid: Player 0 proposes 16 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: D, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 16
    overall: avg=17.69  p30=15.00  std=4.38
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=15.00, conf_mean=15.50 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 16. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
