Bid: Player 0 proposes 27 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:

    chosen_suit: C

      S: pts=[15]  avg=15.00  p30=15.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid: Suit C meets thresholds (p30=27.00, conf_mean=27.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 27. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
