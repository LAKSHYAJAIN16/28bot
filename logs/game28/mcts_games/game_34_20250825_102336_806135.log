    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=15.33  p30=11.00  std=5.68
    failed_checks:
      H: p30 4.00 < 15; conf_mean 8.80 < 15

      S: p30 10.00 < 15; conf_mean 14.20 < 15

    chosen_suit: S
    proposed_bid: 17
    overall: avg=17.25  p30=17.00  std=1.09
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit S meets thresholds (p30=17.00, conf_mean=16.71 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 17. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
