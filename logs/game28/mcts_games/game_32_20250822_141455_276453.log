Bid: Player 0 proposes 26 (min_allowed=16)

    chosen_suit: D
    proposed_bid: 26
    overall: avg=26.00  p30=26.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit D meets thresholds (p30=26.00, conf_mean=26.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 26. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
