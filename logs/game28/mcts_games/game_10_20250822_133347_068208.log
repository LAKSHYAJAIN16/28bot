===== AUCTION =====
Bid: Player 0 proposes 24 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 24
    overall: avg=24.00  p30=24.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=24.00, conf_mean=24.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 24. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
Pass (locked): Player 1 (min_allowed=25)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: D, C, S
    current_high=24  min_allowed=25  raise_delta=1
    overall: avg=10.50  p30=9.00  std=3.04
    failed_checks:
      D: p30 9.00 < 24; conf_mean 8.98 < 24
      S: p30 0.00 < 24; conf_mean 0.00 < 24
    reason: Pass: No suit meets thresholds. Best suit D has p30=9.00, conf_mean=8.98 below min_allowed=25 (current_high=24, raise_delta=+1). Failed checks for best suit: p30 9.00 < 24, conf_mean 8.98 < 24.
