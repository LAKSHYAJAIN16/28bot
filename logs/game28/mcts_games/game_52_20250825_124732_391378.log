===== AUCTION =====
Bid: Player 0 proposes 26 (min_allowed=16)
  bidding analysis:
    present_suits: H, D, C, S
    current_high=0  min_allowed=16  raise_delta=1
    chosen_suit: C
    proposed_bid: 26
    overall: avg=26.00  p30=26.00  std=0.00
    reason: Bid (precomputed): Suit C meets thresholds (p30=26.00, conf_mean=26.00 >= min_allowed=16); conservative mapping max(p30, avg-1) -> 26. (current_high=0, raise_delta=+1)
Pass (locked): Player 1 (min_allowed=27)
